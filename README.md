# Build a Blackjack Game

What began as a tutorial project from [Section 4: Build a Blackjack Game](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript/lets-build-a-blackjack-game-coa954d1fb213d2a9d5a1c8ab) has turned into a personal project.

## Overview

### The Project

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play blackjack against the dealer

### Links

- Live Site URL: https://blackjack-web-app.netlify.app/

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript

### Concepts reinforced

- arrays
- objects
- booleans
- if else statements
- comparison and logical operators
- for loops
- math object
- return statements
- template literals
- DOM manipulation
- functions

### Features beyond scrimba version

- User inputs (name and $ chips)
- User chooses what to value their ace as
- User plays against dealer
- Card icons
- Chips are kept track of so long as the user does not quit the game

### Continued development

Future Additions / improvements:

- Add betting component to the game (double down, split, etc). This could work with a button that changes / manipulates player.chips and renders it on screen in key moments of the game.
- Using local storage to keep track of player's profit / losses. 
- Initially, the amount of $chips the player inputs is subtracted from local storage, reslting in a negative quantity.
- A cashout button that retreives player's current chips and stores them inlocal storage. Subsequently, the chips the player inputs into the game are subtracted from the local storage.
